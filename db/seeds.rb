q0.answers.create(body: "Get seeds. Buy heirloom seeds so that you get tomatoes which are not so bred out. Why grow what you can buy in the supermarket, when you can grow unusual tomatoes which look or taste different? Try shopping from 'seeds of change' Another option to get started is to buy tomato starts from a nursery. That is an OK choice for a beginner.
Prepare your soil. Tomatoes like pretty rich soil. Don't fertilize it with anything unnatural. Don't use chemicals.  Use your compost or locate some organic manure. Try growing them in soil which has not been improved at all
Choose your season and methods. Grow them outdoors at the time of year they want to grow for you with the natural rain cycle. This varies a lot from place to place. The goal is to not use extra water for irrigation but to produce a surplus when there is rain. Using greenhouses and extreme measures is not use good use of resources. You may get an advantage to growing tomato starts early if you have a short growing season. Tomatoes which are not in pots which have more space for their extensive root systems.
Dry the surplus tomatoes. They don't age well, but if you dry the big crop of tomatoes you get during the natural time of year, then your surplus will last all year! They take up little space and can be added to all kinds of dishes!.
Save and share your seeds. Tomatoes are a little unusual in that the seeds have a coating which prevents them from germinating. Place your seeds with a little water in a cup for a couple days so they can ferment a little. They might smell bad. Then dry them out so you can use them when the time is right. How can I save tomato seeds?If you keep saving seeds over generations of plants, then you will have plants which are accustomed to growing in your spots. Make sure to share your seeds with whoever is likely to reproduce them and also save seeds. People should not be held hostage to big companies as seeds suppliers!  You can save the seeds of the tomatoes you get at the grocery store as well and plant those if you have enough space, but the long term win is to use heirlooms and aclimatize the genome to your space and methods. You will end up with more seeds than you know what to do with. You could try planting some on abandoned land in case they can do well and return on their own each year.
Compost:  Keep an eye on your compost pile for tomatoes which come up on their own.
Pests    At some point pests such as aphids or white flies may arrive to attack your tomatoes. Kill some by hand if you wish, but your best long term bet is to attract other insects to eat the insects you don't prefer. Attract  lacewings, ladybugs and aphid predator by planting plant which they like
Learn and teach. Get together with others to see what they are doing and show them what you are doing.
Experiment. Over time your can experiment and see what works where you are. Try planting outdoors earlier, and later than you thing you should. Try planting in different microclimates available to you. Try growing tomatoes upside down in pots. There are many right ways to grow tomatoes. Try planting in ways which are easier and use less resources to discover the easy way even you experience 'failures' along the way.
Have fun!  You create life!")

q0.answers.create(body: "Tomatoes benefit from being planted deeply, well below where they had been growing in their original pot.  You can plant them 6 inches or more below the dirt line.  They grow roots from the stem below the soil, so planting deeply encourages root growth, a bigger plant, and greater sturdiness.  I have never tried this, but I have read quite a few articles that say that using red plastic mulch around your tomato plants greatly increases your yield.
I have found it important either to stake indeterminate tomatoes or to use a tomato cage.  Tomatoes that trail on the ground tend to rot and/or to get eaten by slugs and snails.
Drying your surplus works well, and if you have plenty of freezer space, you might also freeze your tomatoes whole.  Just put them into plastic bags (bread bags are a good size and shape) and freeze.  When you are ready to use them in soups, sauce, etc., just rinse them under warm water.  The skins slip off easily.
I don't know where you live, but in very hot, dry weather it is important to water your tomatoes regularly.  When I lived in the northeast, I water deeply twice a week.")

q1 = Question.create(title: "What are the smart tips for self studying?", body: "Personal hacks that are useful for you, either for arts, sciences etc.
Also examples of ways I could challenge myself as if I were in class.")

q1.answers.create(body: "Here are some of the tips that can be useful for self studying:

Learn one topic in variety of ways. For example, you learn it from textbook, notebook, attend some quizzes about the topic online, etc.
Study all subjects (at least 3) everyday. This method is more effective than studying only one subject each day.
Plan prior to start studying by devoting a time to each subject.
Revise the topics you study periodically, so that the information is passed on to long term memory from short term.
Multi-tasking should be strictly avoided so that you can increase the productivity and better concentrating on studying.
Talking to educational counsellors: This can also help you a lot, as educational counsellors can provide you exclusive tips & also help you better with some tricks to memorise things, etc. There are websites also wherein you can interact with educational counsellors. One of such websites is: YourDOST. Here you can find educational counsellors, IIT alumnus, IIM alumnus, etc with whom you can chat online or book an appointment based on your convenience.")

Use 30-Day Trials. Popularized by Steve Pavlina, trial periods work under the principle that by committing to a change for a month, it will become a habit. Since it is study techniques you want to reinforce, pick one or two habits and work on them for an entire month.
The Learn-It-Once Approach. Spend your time learning things as they come up in your courses. Attend classes with the perspective that you could be tested at any moment. It should only be material that you were just presented that you might not have had time to fully learn. Waiting before tests, assignments or finals is taking things too far.
Morning Review. Wake up a half hour earlier and spend that time reading from your textbook. If you’ve already read the chapters, spend the time rewriting the key concepts into a notebook. A half-hour out of your day in the morning probably won’t create a huge impact on your schedule, yet over the entire term it can be invaluable in boosting your understanding.
Link Courses to Daily Life. Spend some time each week looking for practical ways you can use the information you are learning. If you can find situations from your daily life that are similar to your subjects, they can go from abstract theories to concrete tools.
Background Reading. Invest some of your time each week in reading the background of the ideas surrounding your subjects. Pick out interesting topics in the news or books that make use of ideas from your field of study. Background reading can reinforce the ideas by connecting them with reality.
Set Daily Study Times. Set periods of time that you will spend studying each day. Once you spend a month reinforcing these learning periods, it will become automatic. Regular studying times prevent the need for cramming and can give you consistency in your schedule.
Cut Wasted Time. I’ve had classes where I received an A+, yet I attended less than a third of the lectures. I have had courses where I didn’t buy or read the textbook. Talk to other classmates about how the course is graded (mostly textbook, mostly lectures, etc.) and use that as a basis for deciding where to cut time if you have to. Skipping a class can be a good strategy if it means you could better learn the subject on your own.
Focus on Learning, Not Grades. Grades are just an artificial marker used to assess how much you’ve learned. While they are useful as a measurement tool, focusing on grades over understanding and learning useful ideas wastes your time. Look for ways you can use the material you are learning and focus on understanding it first, put grades afterwards.
Read Papers Upside Down. A good editing habit when checking over your essays and assignments is to read them upside down. This prevents you from speed reading the page and missing grammatical or sentence structure errors. This also gives you a better feeling of how an essay might be read through fresh eyes, letting you improve your style.
The 10-Year Old Rule. Pretend you had to teach everything in your course to a ten-year old. Could you do it? While advanced theoretical physics might not be comprehensible by a young child, the idea is that you should be able to simplify your subject into easily understandable pictures and metaphors. If you can do this for yourself, it will make your job far easier for remembering later.
Seek Your Professors. A great tip from Tim Ferriss in the 4-Hour Workweek involves what to do if you get a bad mark on a paper. He recommends meeting your professor during office hours and asking for suggestions for improvement. Tim recommends that you exhaust every possible question, staying for an hour or two if you have to. By doing this you will not only have a wealth of information about how papers are marked, but your professor will also hesitate to give you a lousy mark in the future.
Schedule a Balance. Compress your work and studying into the weekdays and mornings so you don’t need to work all of the time. Good habits also involve taking time for rest as well.")
